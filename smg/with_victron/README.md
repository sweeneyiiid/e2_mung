# Combining SMG and Victron

 - this code is dependent on the prior execution of SMG and Victron processes
 - see previous notes in `smg` and `victron` folders for upstream dependencies
 
### Program 1

Pulls smg customer subscription data on a pre-defined minigrid (known to have Victron connection data available) by date.

 - Getting data by date is important for joining to Victron data

 
### Program 2

### Same as BGFZ

Combines data from program 1 with pre-existing Victron data (summarized from hour to day).
